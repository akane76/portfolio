            <p>	Hello, my name is Yasmin. I am a freshmen from Dublin High School. My personal career goals that I want to achieve is becoming a translator(in farsi and mandarin) and to become a professional musician. This has became my career choice since in middle school I always found an interest in languages and music. At home I speak both english and farsi. In school I am currently learning mandarin 1. As far back as I can remember I always had a knack for music since, my first instrument was a piano, then a violin, and lastly a saxophone. 

During school and outside of school I have been an ambitious and perspective child who wanted to learn more about instruments and languages including the one I spoke at home. During my work day, a customer who did not know english was having trouble to order, I came in the front and listened what the customer was saying, I realized that they had spoken farsi and that I can take their order. Whenever My mom and speak farsi and I do not know a word I will always ask her what it means and to put it in a sentence so that I can understand. In Dublin High School I have received an award which is called student of the month, “I Am Respectful”. I gotten this award in mandarin class for participating and teaching others if they did not get the lesson we learned. As of now I am currently not participating in any activities. I plan to take some clubs and sports next year so that I am an active member of Dublin High. During the time I was in middle school, I learned how to manage a club. The club I was managing during my middle school years was anime club. I was treasure, then got promoted to vice president, and then in my last year of middle school I was promoted president. These positions taught me how to manage a large group of people and how to deal with funds and profits. This year on September I was hired at Cold Stone Creamery’s as a crew member. Ths job has taught me how to speak clearly, manage my time, and it helps me practice farsi since, there is a halal pizza shop across the store. Working and managing clubs led me to learn an important skill which being perspective and do tasks on time. These skills help me now since, I can now see if people need help and do my homework and projects on time with outside factors.

Thank you for reading till then end and I hope you enjoy looking through the website.

Sincerely,
Yasmin Arellano</p>
