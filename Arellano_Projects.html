            <p>Green Energy
October/10-17/2016, Robotics Class.
	The objective of this project was to create a model of what you think will save energy. I decided to make a portable windmill so that you can always have a small energy maker to take with you in case of an emergency. I made this by using metal parts, gears, screws, bolts, and many more parts. The process of making the model was making a rough draft on paper, getting the rough draft approve, and then start building the model. Towards the end I shrank the model so that it would be life sized.</p>

            <p>Find My Car
September - October 2017, Computer Science and Engineering.
	The objective of this project was to create an app for people to use. My partner, Alex H., and I decided to do a utility app instead of a game since, it would be useful. We had three utility apps to make from which was, find my car, task manager, and anti-snooze alarm. In the end we chose to do Where's my car. We split the work in half meaning, I worked on a draft, and Alex worked on refining it. We both did our part in documenting and overall, the app was a success in the end.</p>

            <p>Shark Chase
August - September 2017, Computer Science and Engineering.
	The objective of this project was to make a game. My partner, Wasi A., and I decided to do some sort of game that included running away. We brainstormed ideas to include mazes, coins, enemy's, and points. Our final conclusion was to make a game about a fish be chased by a shark through a maze. We split in half so that Wasi did the first half which included the opening and the first levels,while I did the last two levels and the ending. We both did our part of the documentation and the game was working overall, being as it was my first time sing scratch.

            <p>Text Adventure
January 2018, CSE.
    The objective of this project was to make a story that has different choices and endings. My partner for this project was Sharma A. We decided to make the story about a students daily routine about school, waking up, etc. The process of making the story was brainstorming what it should be about, chose our best idea, make a diagram of how our idea flows, and start coding our idea. The way we split the work was that Sharma would make the diagram and I would work on the documentation. After the diagram we would switch who would code. We both did our assigned jobs and worked well together even if this project wasnâ€™t our best one.

            <p>Hangman Game
January - February 2018, CSE.
	The objective of this project was to make hangman game using python. My partner, Sharma A. and I decided who would make be responsible for the documentation and who would be responsible for taking it home. I was responsible for the documentation and we both took turns coding after school. The process of making this game was to brainstorm what our topic for hangman should be, how would we organize the code, and discuss about the conclusion question. Overall the project was successful and our teamwork was well matched.

March 2018, CSE.
	The objective of this project was to make a an image collage for a client we chose. My partner, Brian V and I chose a client who wanted historic events. We brainstormed what we should include such as presidents, big protest, or battle events. In the end we chose to do all. The process of making the images was gather the images we wanted, discuss what functions we wanted, discuss who works at home, and how to organize our documentation. Overall the project went well and successful.
