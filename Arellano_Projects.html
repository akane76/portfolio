            <p>Green Energy
October/10-17/2016, Robotics Class
	The objective of this project was to create a model of what you think will save energy. I decided to make a portable windmill so that you can always have a small energy maker to take with you in case of an emergency. I made this by using metal parts, gears, screws, bolts, and many more parts. The process of making the model was making a rough draft on paper, getting the rough draft approve, and then start building the model. Towards the end I shrank the model so that it would be life sized.</p>

            <p>Find My Car
September - October 2017, Computer Science and Engineering
	The objective of this project was to create an app for people to use. My partner, Alex H., and I decided to do a utility app instead of a game since, it would be useful. We had three utility apps to make from which was, find my car, task manager, and anti-snooze alarm. In the end we chose to do Where's my car. We split the work in half meaning, I worked on a draft, and Alex worked on refining it. We both did our part in documenting and overall, the app was a success in the end.</p>

            <p>Shark Chase
August - September 2017, Computer Science and Engineering
	The objective of this project was to make a game. My partner, Wasi A., and I decided to do some sort of game that included running away. We brainstormed ideas to include mazes, coins, enemy's, and points. Our final conclusion was to make a game about a fish be chased by a shark through a maze. We split in half so that Wasi did the first half which included the opening and the first levels,while I did the last two levels and the ending. We both did our part of the documentation and the game was working overall, being as it was my first time sing scratch.
